# Social_Psychology_Research_UCDavis_Graphs

These graphs were created to be used on a scientific journal and on a website, for the Social Psychology Research group at the University of California, Davis. 

**Important Note:** Graphs were created with a library called Plotly. They cannot be viewed normally in Github. In order to view them you must click on the icon with a circle and a line across it, which you can find at the top of the file page, just underneath the "Download" button. When you hover over the icon it will say "Limited rendering only, external view available with nbviewer". Click on the blue text you see when hovering the icon, and you will be able to see all the graphs.
